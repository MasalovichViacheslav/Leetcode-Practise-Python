703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream

You are part of a university admissions office and need to keep track of the kth highest test score from applicants in
real-time. This helps to determine cut-off marks for interviews and admissions dynamically as new applicants submit
their scores.

You are tasked to implement a class which, for a given integer k, maintains a stream of test scores and continuously
returns the kth highest test score after a new score has been submitted. More specifically, we are looking for the kth
highest score in the sorted list of all scores.

Implement the KthLargest class:
- KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer k and the stream of test scores nums.
- int add(int val) Adds a new test score val to the stream and returns the element representing the kth largest element
in the pool of test scores so far.

Example 1:
Input:
["KthLargest", "add", "add", "add", "add", "add"]
[[3, [4, 5, 8, 2]], [3], [5], [10], [9], [4]]
Output: [null, 4, 5, 5, 8, 8]
Explanation:
KthLargest kthLargest = new KthLargest(3, [4, 5, 8, 2]);
kthLargest.add(3); // return 4
kthLargest.add(5); // return 5
kthLargest.add(10); // return 5
kthLargest.add(9); // return 8
kthLargest.add(4); // return 8

Example 2:

Input:
["KthLargest", "add", "add", "add", "add"]
[[4, [7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 3]], [2], [10], [9], [9]]

Output: [null, 7, 7, 7, 8]

Explanation:

KthLargest kthLargest = new KthLargest(4, [7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 3]);
kthLargest.add(2); // return 7
kthLargest.add(10); // return 7
kthLargest.add(9); // return 7
kthLargest.add(9); // return 8


Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 10**4
1 <= k <= nums.length + 1
-10**4 <= nums[i] <= 10**4
-10**4 <= val <= 10**4
At most 10**4 calls will be made to add.

347. Top K Frequent Elements

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any 
order. 

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
 

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 10**5
-10**4 <= nums[i] <= 10**4
k is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array].
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

Follow up: Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.

215. Kth Largest Element in an Array

'''
973. K Closest Points to Origin

Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k 
closest points to the origin (0, 0).
The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

Example 1:
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].

Example 2:
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.
 

Constraints:
1 <= k <= points.length <= 10**4
-10**4 <= xi, yi <= 10**4
